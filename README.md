# XGP-Shortcut

This app creates a shortcut on the Windows desktop for Xbox Game Pass games with an icon and launch arguments.

This project uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) to convert the icon included in the game's install folder into an ICO file, and allows the user to add launch arguments to the game's executable before sending it to the Windows desktop.

A few common arguments are provided in the drop-down, and can be selected and added to the arguments box. Arguments can also be manually typed into this box.
